- 👋 Hi, I’m @atmamvura
- 👀 I’m interested in coding mostly mobile apps. My area at the end is to create apps that teach others to do something or to provide a service.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning android java but I am a beginner. I now know how to read codes and here and there how to formulate but I am still learning howto turn that into a package.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small to large projects that can help me to code independently and later on to do my own projects. Ineed the basic skills nowof thinking and acting like a developer.
- 📫 How to reach me on email tirivavirimamvura@gmail.com or whatsapp on +27 78 023 5440, on twitter (TMamvura1)
